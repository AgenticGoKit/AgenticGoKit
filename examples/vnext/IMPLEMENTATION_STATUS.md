# ⚠️ Important Note About vNext Implementation Status

## Current Status

The **vNext API** provides a clean, unified interface for building agents, but the **builder implementation is currently a placeholder**. The `streamlinedAgent` created by `vnext.NewBuilder()` returns mock responses instead of actually calling LLM providers.

### What Works
✅ API design and interfaces  
✅ Configuration system (TOML, programmatic)  
✅ Builder pattern and presets  
✅ Type safety and compile-time checks  

### What's Not Implemented Yet
❌ Actual LLM provider integration in vnext builder  
❌ Real tool execution  
❌ Memory operations  
❌ Streaming responses  

## Current Behavior

When you run the examples, you'll see output like:

```
✓ Answer: Agent 'ollama-helper' processed: What is GraphQL?
   Duration: 0s
```

This is a **mock response**, not actual LLM output.

## Workarounds

Until the vNext implementation is complete, you have these options:

### Option 1: Use Core SimpleAgent API

The `core.SimpleAgent` API is fully implemented and works with all LLM providers:

```go
import (
    "github.com/kunalkushwaha/agenticgokit/core"
    _ "github.com/kunalkushwaha/agenticgokit/plugins/llm/ollama"
)

func main() {
    agent := core.NewSimpleAgentBuilder("my-agent").
        WithLLM("ollama", "llama3.2").
        WithSystemPrompt("You are helpful").
        Build()
    
    result, err := agent.Run(ctx, "Hello!")
    fmt.Println(result.Output) // Real LLM response
}
```

### Option 2: Use Factory Pattern

```go
import "github.com/kunalkushwaha/agenticgokit/core"

agent := core.CreateAgent(core.AgentConfig{
    Name:         "test",
    LLMProvider:  "ollama",
    LLMModel:     "llama3.2",
    SystemPrompt: "You are helpful",
})
```

### Option 3: Wait for Full Implementation

The vNext builder will be fully implemented to connect to actual LLM providers. Track progress in the main repository.

## Why Create These Examples?

These examples demonstrate:

1. **API Design**: How the vNext API *should* work once implemented
2. **Configuration Patterns**: TOML config, builder pattern, quickstart functions
3. **Code Structure**: Best practices for agent applications
4. **Interface Usage**: How to use the public APIs correctly

## Learning Value

Even though the implementation is incomplete, these examples are valuable for:

- Understanding the intended API design
- Learning configuration patterns
- Preparing code for when implementation is complete
- Contributing to the implementation

## Next Steps for Contributors

To complete the vNext implementation, the `streamlinedAgent.Run()` method needs to:

1. Initialize the configured LLM provider
2. Make actual LLM API calls
3. Handle tool execution
4. Manage memory operations
5. Support streaming responses

## Recommended Approach for Now

**For production use**, use the fully-implemented `core.SimpleAgent` API:

```bash
cd examples/01-simple-agent  # Fully working example
go run main.go
```

**For learning vNext APIs**, study these examples to understand:
- Configuration patterns
- Builder patterns  
- API design
- Best practices

**Status**: vNext API design is complete and stable. Implementation is in progress.
