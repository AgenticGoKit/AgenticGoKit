# vnext Workflow Streaming Bug Fix - Design & Task List

## 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Fix the vnext.Workflow streaming implementation to enable proper multi-agent workflows with real-time streaming support.

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Individual agent streaming works perfectly
- ✅ Workflow streaming FIXED - no more "context canceled" errors!
- ✅ Real vnext.Workflow streaming working reliably
- 🔧 Manual orchestration workaround no longer needed

**Target**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - `workflow.RunStream()` now works as reliably as direct `agent.RunStream()`

---

## 🐛 Bug Analysis Summary

### Root Cause
Context management issues in the workflow streaming implementation causing premature cancellation.

### Specific Issues Identified
1. **Context Timeout Conflict**: Workflow timeout context cancels before agents complete
2. **Goroutine Context Inheritance**: Same context used for workflow coordination and agent execution
3. **Poor Error Reporting**: Vague "context canceled" errors without details
4. **Stream Writer Robustness**: Potential panic/corruption in stream operations

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Sequential workflow with streaming should work reliably
- ✅ Individual agent streaming within workflow should display tokens in real-time
- ✅ Data should flow correctly between workflow steps
- ✅ Error handling should provide clear diagnostics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Performance should match direct agent streaming
- ✅ Context cancellation should be predictable and controlled
- ✅ Stream integrity should be maintained throughout workflow execution
- ✅ Configuration validation should prevent invalid setups

---

## 🛠️ Technical Design

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Context Separation Strategy
```
Before (Broken):
┌─────────────────┐
│ Workflow Context│ (with timeout)
│       ↓         │
│ Agent Execution │ (inherits timeout, cancels early)
└─────────────────┘

After (Fixed):
┌─────────────────┐
│ Workflow Context│ (coordination only)
└─────────────────┘
┌─────────────────┐
│ Agent Context   │ (separate, longer timeout)
└─────────────────┘
```

#### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- Context cancellation detection at each step
- Detailed error context with step information
- Recovery mechanisms for stream failures

#### 3. Stream Writer Robustness
- Defensive programming for stream operations
- Panic recovery in goroutines
- Stream integrity validation
