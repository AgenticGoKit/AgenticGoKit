## Summary

Sprint 1 lays the foundation by defining a Go-native `Event` interface and building a thread-safe `Runner` core service for event dispatch, following Go idioms for interface design and error-first practices for clear code structure citeturn0search0turn0search4. It also implements two orchestration modes—route via round-robin distribution and collaborate via fan-out/fan-in concurrency—to support flexible, high-throughput workflows with built-in unit test coverage citeturn1search1turn0search1.

The following tasks align with agile sprint planning best practices of crafting small, well-defined, testable stories within team capacity citeturn2search4.

## Sprint 1 Developer Tasks

### 1. Define the `Event` Interface  
- **Task**: Create a Go `Event` interface with fields `ID string`, `Payload interface{}`, and `Metadata map[string]string` to standardize input contracts. citeturn0search0  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Write unit tests using `encoding/json` to serialize and deserialize `Event` instances, ensuring accurate JSON marshalling/unmarshalling. citeturn0search2  

### 2. Implement the `Runner` Core Service  
- **Task**: Develop a `Runner` struct with methods `RegisterAgent(name string, agent Agent)` and `Emit(event Event)`, backed by an in-memory FIFO queue. citeturn1search1  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure thread safety using channels or `sync.Mutex`, and add unit tests to verify correct FIFO ordering under concurrent `Emit` calls. citeturn0search4  

### 3. Develop the “route” Orchestration Mode  
- **Task**: Implement `RouteOrchestrator` that delivers each event to exactly one registered agent using a round-robin algorithm. citeturn0search1  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Create unit tests simulating multiple agents and events to confirm fair distribution and proper handling when agents fail. citeturn1search0  

### 4. Develop the “collaborate” Orchestration Mode  
- **Task**: Build `CollaborateOrchestrator` employing the fan-out/fan-in concurrency pattern to dispatch each event in parallel to all agents. citeturn1search1  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Implement error aggregation and timeout handling to collect results from each agent, with unit tests covering partial failures and time-bounded execution. citeturn1search4
