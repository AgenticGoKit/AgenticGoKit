# AgentFlow Documentation

The Go SDK for building production-ready multi-agent AI systems.

AgentFlow makes it incredibly simple to build and prototype AI agent workflows in Go. From a single intelligent agent to complex multi-agent orchestrations, AgentFlow provides the SDK foundation and scaffolding you need to develop AI applications with production-ready patterns.

## Features

- **30-Second Setup** - Generate working multi-agent systems with a single CLI command
- **LLM-Driven Tool Discovery** - Agents automatically find and use the right tools via MCP protocol  
- **Production-First** - Built-in error handling, observability, and enterprise patterns
- **Unified API** - One clean interface for all LLM providers and tool integrations
- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Go with minimal external requirements
- **Developer Experience** - From prototype to production without rewriting code

## What Makes AgentFlow Special?

AgentFlow is designed for developers who want to:

- **Build intelligent, event-driven workflows** with configurable orchestration patterns
- **Integrate multiple agents and tools** into cohesive, observable systems  
- **Leverage any LLM provider** (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama) through unified interfaces
- **Create modular, extensible AI systems** that scale from prototype to production
- **Focus on business logic** while AgentFlow handles the infrastructure complexity

Whether you're prototyping a single-agent application or orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows, AgentFlow provides the tools and abstractions to get started quickly and scale reliably.
