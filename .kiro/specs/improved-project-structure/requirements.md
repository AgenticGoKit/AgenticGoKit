# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the project structure generated by the `agentcli create` command. Currently, all generated files are placed in the root directory of the project, which creates a cluttered and unprofessional structure. The improved structure should organize code into logical subdirectories, separate agent implementations from configuration files, and provide clear placeholders where developers need to make customizations for their specific requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using agentcli, I want generated projects to have a well-organized directory structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain my agent-based applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `agentcli create`, THEN the system SHALL generate a project with a structured directory layout instead of placing all files in the root
2. WHEN the project is generated, THEN agent implementation files SHALL be placed in a dedicated `agents/` subdirectory
3. WHEN the project is generated, THEN configuration files SHALL remain in the root directory for easy access
4. WHEN the project is generated, THEN the system SHALL create additional organizational directories such as `internal/`, `cmd/`, or similar as appropriate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear placeholders and comments in generated code, so that I know exactly where and what to modify for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code files are generated, THEN the system SHALL include clear TODO comments indicating where developers need to make changes
2. WHEN configuration files are generated, THEN the system SHALL include placeholder values with descriptive comments explaining what each setting does
3. WHEN agent files are generated, THEN the system SHALL include example implementations with clear markers for customization points
4. WHEN the main entry point is generated, THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining the overall flow and integration points

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project structure to follow Go best practices, so that my project is maintainable and follows community standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is generated, THEN the directory structure SHALL follow standard Go project layout conventions
2. WHEN package names are assigned, THEN they SHALL follow Go naming conventions and be appropriate for their directory location
3. WHEN import paths are generated, THEN they SHALL correctly reference the new directory structure
4. WHEN the go.mod file is created, THEN it SHALL properly define the module with appropriate naming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example documentation and README files, so that I can quickly understand how to use and extend the generated project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is generated, THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive README.md file explaining the project structure
2. WHEN the README is created, THEN it SHALL include sections for getting started, customization points, and project structure explanation
3. WHEN agent files are generated, THEN they SHALL include inline documentation explaining their purpose and how to modify them
4. WHEN configuration files are generated, THEN they SHALL include comments explaining available options and their effects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project to be immediately runnable, so that I can verify the setup works before making customizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is generated, THEN it SHALL compile successfully without any modifications
2. WHEN the generated project is run, THEN it SHALL execute without errors and demonstrate basic functionality
3. WHEN dependencies are specified, THEN they SHALL be properly declared in go.mod and importable
4. WHEN the project structure is created, THEN all import paths SHALL be valid and resolvable
