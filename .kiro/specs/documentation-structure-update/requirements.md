# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to update all project documentation to reflect the new improved project structure implemented in the scaffold system. The current documentation references the old flat project structure where agent files were in the root directory, but the new structure organizes files into `agents/`, `internal/`, and `docs/` directories. This misalignment between documentation and actual generated projects creates confusion for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Update Main Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer reading the main README, I want to see accurate project structure examples so that I understand what files will be generated and where they are located.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the main README.md THEN they SHALL see project structure examples that match the new organized directory layout
2. WHEN the README describes generated files THEN it SHALL reference the correct file paths (e.g., `agents/agent1.go` instead of `agent1.go`)
3. WHEN the README mentions project structure benefits THEN it SHALL highlight the improved organization with `agents/`, `internal/`, and `docs/` directories
4. WHEN code examples are shown THEN they SHALL use correct import paths reflecting the new structure

### Requirement 2: Update Tutorial Documentation

**User Story:** As a new user following tutorials, I want the documentation to match the actual generated project structure so that I can successfully follow along without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows the "Your First Agent" tutorial THEN the project structure diagrams SHALL match the new organized layout
2. WHEN tutorials show file locations THEN they SHALL reference files in their correct directories (agents/, internal/, docs/)
3. WHEN tutorials provide code examples THEN they SHALL use correct import statements for the new structure
4. WHEN tutorials mention file editing THEN they SHALL specify the correct file paths
5. WHEN users run tutorial examples THEN the file references SHALL be accurate and functional

### Requirement 3: Update Guide Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer reading development guides, I want project structure recommendations and examples to reflect current best practices so that my projects follow the recommended organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the best practices guide shows project organization THEN it SHALL demonstrate the new directory structure
2. WHEN guides reference specific files THEN they SHALL use correct paths relative to the new structure
3. WHEN development guides show code organization THEN they SHALL align with the scaffold-generated structure
4. WHEN guides mention file locations THEN they SHALL be consistent with the new organized layout

### Requirement 4: Update Reference Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer using the CLI reference, I want examples and descriptions to accurately reflect what files are generated and where they are placed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLI documentation shows generated project examples THEN they SHALL display the new directory structure
2. WHEN command descriptions mention file generation THEN they SHALL specify correct output locations
3. WHEN CLI examples are provided THEN they SHALL reference files in their actual generated locations
4. WHEN troubleshooting guides reference files THEN they SHALL use correct paths

### Requirement 5: Add Migration Guidance

**User Story:** As a developer with existing projects using the old structure, I want guidance on how to migrate to the new structure so that I can benefit from the improved organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has an existing project with old structure THEN they SHALL find clear migration instructions
2. WHEN migration steps are provided THEN they SHALL include file movement commands and import path updates
3. WHEN migration guidance is given THEN it SHALL explain the benefits of the new structure
4. WHEN users migrate THEN they SHALL have a checklist to verify successful migration

### Requirement 6: Ensure Documentation Consistency

**User Story:** As a user reading different parts of the documentation, I want consistent terminology and structure references so that I don't encounter conflicting information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation refers to project structure THEN it SHALL use consistent terminology across all documents
2. WHEN file paths are mentioned THEN they SHALL be consistent throughout all documentation
3. WHEN directory names are referenced THEN they SHALL match the actual generated directory names
4. WHEN code examples are shown THEN they SHALL use consistent import patterns and file organization

### Requirement 7: Update Visual Documentation

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want diagrams and examples to accurately represent the current project structure so that I can quickly understand the organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project structure diagrams are shown THEN they SHALL reflect the new organized directory layout
2. WHEN file tree examples are provided THEN they SHALL show the correct hierarchy with agents/, internal/, and docs/ folders
3. WHEN workflow diagrams reference files THEN they SHALL use correct file paths
4. WHEN visual examples are updated THEN they SHALL maintain clarity and readability

### Requirement 8: Validate Documentation Accuracy

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to ensure all documentation updates are accurate and complete so that users have reliable information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all file path references SHALL be verified against actual generated projects
2. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL be tested to ensure they work with the new structure
3. WHEN migration instructions are given THEN they SHALL be validated through actual migration testing
4. WHEN documentation changes are made THEN they SHALL be reviewed for consistency and accuracy
