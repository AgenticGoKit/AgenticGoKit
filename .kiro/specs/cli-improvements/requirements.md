# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to improve the AgenticGoKit CLI (agentcli) by fixing existing issues, enhancing command organization, adding missing functionality, and improving the overall user experience. The current CLI has several issues including a non-functional version command, inconsistent help output, missing commands mentioned in documentation, and suboptimal command organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Version Command Registration

**User Story:** As a user of the agentcli tool, I want to be able to check the version information so that I can verify which version I'm running and report issues accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `agentcli version` THEN the command SHALL execute successfully and display version information
2. WHEN a user runs `agentcli --version` or `agentcli -v` THEN the command SHALL display the same version information
3. WHEN the version command is executed THEN it SHALL show the version number, git commit, build date, and platform information
4. WHEN the version command is built with proper ldflags THEN it SHALL display actual version information instead of "dev"

### Requirement 2: Improve Command Organization and Help Output

**User Story:** As a user exploring the CLI capabilities, I want clear and well-organized help output so that I can quickly understand available commands and their purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `agentcli --help` THEN the output SHALL be organized into logical categories with clear descriptions
2. WHEN commands are displayed THEN they SHALL be grouped by functionality (Project Management, Development & Debug, MCP & Tools, Utilities)
3. WHEN help text is shown THEN it SHALL be consistent in format and terminology across all commands
4. WHEN a user runs `agentcli` without arguments THEN it SHALL show helpful information instead of just basic usage

### Requirement 3: Add Missing Commands Referenced in Documentation

**User Story:** As a user following documentation, I want all commands mentioned in help text and documentation to be available so that I can use the full functionality described.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation mentions commands like `info`, `update`, `logs`, `config`, `health`, `status` THEN these commands SHALL be implemented or removed from documentation
2. WHEN a user runs `agentcli info` THEN it SHALL show current project information and status
3. WHEN a user runs `agentcli health` THEN it SHALL check system health and connectivity
4. WHEN missing commands are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the same patterns as existing commands

### Requirement 4: Enhance Existing Commands with Better UX

**User Story:** As a user working with the CLI, I want consistent and intuitive command interfaces so that I can work efficiently without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands have flags THEN they SHALL use consistent naming conventions and short forms
2. WHEN commands produce output THEN they SHALL support multiple output formats (table, json, yaml) where appropriate
3. WHEN commands encounter errors THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN commands have subcommands THEN they SHALL be organized logically with clear help text

### Requirement 5: Improve Command Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user making mistakes with CLI commands, I want helpful error messages and suggestions so that I can correct my usage quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides invalid arguments THEN the command SHALL show specific error messages with suggestions
2. WHEN a user runs a command with missing required arguments THEN it SHALL show what arguments are needed
3. WHEN a user runs a command in the wrong context THEN it SHALL explain the correct usage context
4. WHEN commands fail THEN they SHALL provide actionable next steps

### Requirement 6: Add Command Completion and Shell Integration

**User Story:** As a user working frequently with the CLI, I want shell completion support so that I can work more efficiently with tab completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `agentcli completion bash` THEN it SHALL generate bash completion scripts
2. WHEN a user runs `agentcli completion zsh` THEN it SHALL generate zsh completion scripts
3. WHEN a user runs `agentcli completion powershell` THEN it SHALL generate PowerShell completion scripts
4. WHEN completion is installed THEN it SHALL provide intelligent suggestions for commands, flags, and arguments

### Requirement 7: Standardize Output Formatting and Verbosity

**User Story:** As a user integrating the CLI into scripts and workflows, I want consistent output formatting and verbosity controls so that I can parse output reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands support multiple output formats THEN they SHALL consistently support --output/-o flag with json, yaml, table options
2. WHEN commands have verbose output THEN they SHALL support --verbose/-v flag for detailed information
3. WHEN commands produce structured data THEN the JSON output SHALL be properly formatted and parseable
4. WHEN commands run in quiet mode THEN they SHALL support --quiet/-q flag to suppress non-essential output

### Requirement 8: Redesign Create Command Structure and Options

**User Story:** As a user creating new AgenticGoKit projects, I want a simplified and intuitive create command interface so that I can quickly scaffold projects without being overwhelmed by complex flag combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `agentcli create` THEN it SHALL provide a clear, organized interface for project creation
2. WHEN the create command has many options THEN they SHALL be logically grouped and easy to discover
3. WHEN a user wants to create common project types THEN there SHALL be preset templates or simplified workflows
4. WHEN a user needs advanced configuration THEN it SHALL be available without cluttering the basic experience
5. WHEN flag combinations are invalid THEN the command SHALL provide clear guidance on correct usage
6. WHEN a user runs `agentcli create --help` THEN the help output SHALL be well-organized and not overwhelming
7. WHEN multiple flags serve similar purposes THEN they SHALL be consolidated into single, more meaningful options
8. WHEN flags have overlapping functionality THEN they SHALL be merged or redesigned to eliminate redundancy
9. WHEN flag names are verbose or unclear THEN they SHALL be simplified to be more intuitive and memorable

### Requirement 9: Remove Emojis from CLI Output

**User Story:** As a user working with the CLI in various environments and scripts, I want clean text-only output so that the CLI works consistently across all terminals and automation scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any CLI command produces output THEN it SHALL NOT include emoji characters
2. WHEN help text is displayed THEN it SHALL use plain text symbols or prefixes instead of emojis
3. WHEN status messages are shown THEN they SHALL use text-based indicators (like [INFO], [WARN], [ERROR])
4. WHEN command categories are displayed THEN they SHALL use text labels instead of emoji icons

### Requirement 10: Add Project Context Awareness

**User Story:** As a user working with AgenticGoKit projects, I want the CLI to understand project context so that commands can provide relevant information and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs commands in a project directory THEN the CLI SHALL detect and use project configuration
2. WHEN a user runs `agentcli info` in a project THEN it SHALL show project-specific information
3. WHEN a user runs validation commands THEN they SHALL check against the current project structure
4. WHEN commands need project context THEN they SHALL provide clear messages if run outside a project
