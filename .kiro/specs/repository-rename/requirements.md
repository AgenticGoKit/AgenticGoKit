# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating all references from the old repository name `agentflow` to the new repository name `AgenticGoKit` throughout the codebase. The project was renamed from `https://github.com/kunalkushwaha/agentflow` to `https://github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`, and all internal dependencies, import statements, module declarations, documentation links, and configuration references need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the AgenticGoKit framework, I want all import statements to use the correct new repository name, so that my code can properly resolve dependencies and build successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the go.mod file is examined THEN the module declaration SHALL be `github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`
2. WHEN any Go file contains import statements THEN all imports SHALL reference `github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit` instead of `github.com/kunalkushwaha/agentflow`
3. WHEN the codebase is built THEN there SHALL be no import resolution errors related to the old repository name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with scaffold templates, I want all generated code to use the correct repository references, so that scaffolded projects work correctly with the renamed framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scaffold templates generate Go code THEN all import statements SHALL use `github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`
2. WHEN scaffold templates generate go.mod files THEN the require statement SHALL reference `github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`
3. WHEN scaffold templates generate documentation THEN all GitHub links SHALL point to the new repository URL
4. WHEN scaffold template files in `internal/scaffold/templates/` contain import statements THEN they SHALL use the new repository name
5. WHEN scaffold generator code creates import statements THEN they SHALL reference the correct new repository name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading documentation and examples, I want all links and references to point to the correct repository, so that I can access the right resources and follow working examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation contains GitHub links THEN all links SHALL point to `https://github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`
2. WHEN example code contains import statements THEN all imports SHALL use the new repository name
3. WHEN example go.mod files are examined THEN they SHALL require the correct module name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using configuration files, I want all configuration references and comments to use the correct naming, so that the configuration is consistent with the new branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files contain references to "agentflow" THEN they SHALL be updated to use appropriate new naming
2. WHEN configuration file names reference "agentflow" THEN they SHALL be evaluated for potential renaming to maintain consistency
3. WHEN error messages or help text reference the old name THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect the new branding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using scaffolding functionality, I want all template files to generate code with correct repository references, so that scaffolded projects work immediately without manual fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN template files in `internal/scaffold/templates/` are processed THEN all generated import statements SHALL use `github.com/kunalkushwaha/AgenticGoKit`
2. WHEN scaffold generators create go.mod content THEN the module require statements SHALL reference the new repository name
3. WHEN template files generate documentation links THEN all GitHub URLs SHALL point to the new repository location
4. WHEN scaffold templates contain hardcoded repository references THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new name

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the project, I want all internal code references to be consistent with the new naming, so that the codebase maintains consistency and professionalism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internal package imports reference the old repository THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new repository name
2. WHEN variable names or aliases use "agentflow" THEN they SHALL be evaluated for consistency with new naming conventions
3. WHEN comments or documentation strings reference the old name THEN they SHALL be updated appropriately
4. WHEN scaffold utility functions generate repository references THEN they SHALL use the correct new repository name
