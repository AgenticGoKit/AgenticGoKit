# Development Guides

Guides for developing, testing, and debugging AgenticGoKit applications.

## Available Guides

### [Testing Agents](testing-agents.md)
Comprehensive guide to testing multi-agent systems, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing strategies.

**When to use:** Building reliable agent systems that need thorough testing coverage.

### [Debugging](debugging.md)
Debug agent interactions, trace execution flows, and troubleshoot common issues in multi-agent systems.

**When to use:** When agents aren't behaving as expected or you need to understand execution flow.

### [Best Practices](best-practices.md)
Development best practices for building maintainable, scalable, and robust agent systems.

**When to use:** Starting a new project or improving existing agent implementations.

## Development Workflow

Recommended development workflow:

1. **Design your agents** - Plan agent responsibilities and interactions
2. **Implement incrementally** - Start with simple agents, add complexity gradually
3. **Test continuously** - Use [Testing Agents](testing-agents.md) strategies
4. **Debug systematically** - Apply [Debugging](debugging.md) techniques
5. **Follow best practices** - Reference [Best Practices](best-practices.md)

## Development Tools

AgenticGoKit provides several tools to help with development:

- **agentcli** - Command-line tool for tracing and debugging
- **Configuration validation** - Built-in config validation
- **Logging and tracing** - Comprehensive observability features

## Code Quality

All guides emphasize:
- **Error handling** - Proper error management patterns
- **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation** - Clear code documentation
- **Performance** - Efficient resource usage

## Next Steps

After development:
- [Deployment Guides](../deployment/README.md) for production deployment
- [Setup Guides](../setup/README.md) for configuration management
- [API Reference](../../reference/README.md) for detailed documentation
