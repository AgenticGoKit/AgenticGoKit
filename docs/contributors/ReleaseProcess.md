# Release Process

This document describes the comprehensive release process for AgentFlow, including versioning, testing, documentation, and deployment procedures.

## üéØ Release Philosophy

AgentFlow follows a disciplined release process to ensure:
- **Stability**: Thorough testing before releases
- **Predictability**: Regular release schedule and clear versioning
- **Transparency**: Open communication about changes and timeline
- **Quality**: Comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities

## üìÖ Release Schedule

### Regular Release Cycle

| Release Type | Frequency | Content | Timeline |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Major** | Every 6 months | Breaking changes, major features | January, July |
| **Minor** | Monthly | New features, improvements | First Tuesday of each month |
| **Patch** | As needed | Bug fixes, security updates | Within 1-2 weeks of issue |
| **Pre-release** | Weekly | Development snapshots | Every Friday |

### Special Releases

- **Security Releases**: Immediate for critical security issues
- **Hotfixes**: Same day for critical production bugs
- **LTS Releases**: Long-term support versions (annual)

## üìù Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

AgentFlow uses semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```
v2.3.1
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ Patch: Bug fixes, security updates
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Minor: New features, improvements (backward compatible)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Major: Breaking changes, architectural updates
```

### Version Examples

| Version | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `v1.0.0` | Major | Initial stable release |
| `v1.1.0` | Minor | Added MCP caching, new CLI commands |
| `v1.1.1` | Patch | Fixed memory leak in tool execution |
| `v2.0.0` | Major | New agent interface, breaking config changes |
| `v2.1.0-rc.1` | Pre-release | Release candidate with new features |
| `v1.5.0-lts` | LTS | Long-term support release |

### Pre-release Identifiers

- `alpha`: Early development, unstable
- `beta`: Feature complete, testing phase
- `rc`: Release candidate, production ready

Examples: `v1.2.0-alpha.1`, `v1.2.0-beta.2`, `v1.2.0-rc.1`

## üöÄ Release Process Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase (2 weeks before release)

#### Release Planning Meeting
- Review completed features and fixes
- Assess breaking changes and migration needs
- Plan documentation updates
- Set release timeline and responsibilities

#### Create Release Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
git push origin release/v1.2.0
```

#### Update Version Information
```bash
# Update version in all relevant files
./scripts/update-version.sh v1.2.0

# Files typically updated:
# - go.mod
# - cmd/agentcli/main.go
# - docs/README.md
# - CHANGELOG.md
```

### 2. Development Freeze (1 week before release)

#### Code Freeze
- No new features added to release branch
- Only critical bug fixes allowed
- All changes require release manager approval

#### Pre-release Testing
```bash
# Create pre-release
git tag v1.2.0-rc.1
git push origin v1.2.0-rc.1

# Trigger CI/CD pipeline
gh workflow run release.yml --ref v1.2.0-rc.1
```

### 3. Release Testing (3-5 days)

## üö® Hotfix Process

### Emergency Hotfix Workflow

For critical production issues requiring immediate fixes:

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1

# 2. Apply minimal fix
# Edit necessary files
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical security vulnerability in MCP authentication"

# 3. Update version
./scripts/update-version.sh v1.2.1

# 4. Run critical tests
make test-security
make test-integration

# 5. Create hotfix release
git tag v1.2.1
git push origin hotfix/v1.2.1
git push origin v1.2.1

# 6. Merge back to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/v1.2.1
git push origin main

# 7. Trigger emergency release
gh workflow run hotfix-release.yml --ref v1.2.1
```

### Hotfix Criteria

Hotfixes are reserved for:
- **Security vulnerabilities** (especially those with public disclosure)
- **Data corruption or loss** issues
- **Complete system failures** affecting all users
- **Legal compliance** issues requiring immediate resolution
