## Summary

Below is a 6-sprint, 12-week roadmap that breaks your architecture into epics and granular user stories. Each sprint spans two weeks and contains 4–6 stories, complete with brief acceptance criteria. This structure will help your PM translate high-level goals into actionable tasks and let developers pick up well-defined user stories each sprint.

## Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Core Runner & Orchestration

**Epic**: Establish the heart of the framework—the Runner—that ingests events and dispatches to agents in different orchestration modes.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want an `Event` interface so that all agent workflows can receive a uniform input structure.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Define Go interface `Event` with common fields (ID, payload, metadata).  
   - Unit tests for JSON (un)marshalling of `Event`.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `Runner` core service to register and emit events so workflows can start.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Implement `Runner.RegisterAgent(name string, agent Agent)`.  
   - Implement `Runner.Emit(event Event)`.  
   - In-memory event queue with FIFO ordering.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a “route” mode so a single event is forwarded to exactly one agent.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - `RouteOrchestrator` picks agent by round-robin or weighted rules.  
   - Unit tests covering routing logic.  

4. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a “collaborate” mode so multiple agents can process the same event in parallel.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - `CollaborateOrchestrator` invokes all registered agents concurrently.  
   - Proper error aggregation and timeout handling.

## Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): Deterministic Workflow Agents

**Epic**: Build non-LLM workflow primitives for structured pipelines, enabling hybrid flows without external model calls.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `SequentialAgent` that runs a list of sub-agents in order.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Accepts `[]Agent`, executes one after another, passing state forward.  
   - Error short-circuit: stops on first failure.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `ParallelAgent` that runs sub-agents concurrently and aggregates results.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Executes `[]Agent` with Go routines and channels.  
   - Collects outputs and errors into a slice.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `LoopAgent` that repeats a sub-agent until a condition is met.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Accepts a `ConditionFunc(State) bool`.  
   - Safety cap on max iterations.  

4. **User Story**: As a developer, I want the workflow agents wired into the Runner so they can be used in orchestrator modes.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Runner can dispatch to any Agent (including workflow agents).  
   - Integration tests for nested workflows.

## Sprint 3 (Weeks 5–6): ModelProvider & Tool Integration

**Epic**: Abstract LLM backends and build in essential tools for agents to call.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `ModelProvider` interface so any LLM can be plugged in.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Define methods `Call(ctx, Prompt) (Response, error)`.  
   - Mock implementation for tests.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want an `OpenAIAdapter` that implements `ModelProvider` for OpenAI’s APIs.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Supports streaming and non-streaming calls.  
   - Configurable via environment variables.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want an `OllamaAdapter` for local LLM hosting (Ollama).  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - HTTP client to local Ollama server.  
   - Fallback to file-based prompts if server unavailable.  

4. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a generic `FunctionTool` so agents can execute external functions.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Register named functions with signature `func(Context) (Output, error)`.  
   - Example tools: web search stub, code executor.

## Sprint 4 (Weeks 7–8): Memory & Artifact Management

**Epic**: Build short-term session storage, long-term memory via vector DB, and file artifact handling.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want an in-memory `SessionStore` to keep per-user conversation state.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - CRUD operations for `Session` and `State` objects.  
   - Concurrency-safe with mutexes or sync.Map.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `VectorMemory` interface with a Pinecone driver.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Methods `Store(embedding, metadata)`, `Query(embedding, k)`.  
   - Integration tests with Pinecone sandbox.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a file `ArtifactService` to save and version artifacts like logs or images.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Local FS backend storing files under `/artifacts/{sessionID}/`.  
   - Metadata JSON manifest for each artifact.  

4. **User Story**: As a developer, I want the memory and artifact services injected into Runner so agents can access them.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Dependency injection via `RunnerConfig`.  
   - Sample agent that writes a debug log artifact.

## Sprint 5 (Weeks 9–10): Debugging, Callbacks & CLI

**Epic**: Enable deep introspection with hooks, traces, and a command-line inspector.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want pre- and post-call callbacks around model and tool invocations.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Register callbacks `OnBeforeCall`, `OnAfterCall`.  
   - Callback context includes input, output, timestamps.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a `TraceLogger` that records each execution step into an in-memory log.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Structured log entries for each agent invocation.  
   - APIs to stream or retrieve trace logs by session ID.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a CLI command `agentcli trace <sessionID>` to replay an execution trace.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Tabular or tree-view output in the terminal.  
   - Flags for filtering by agent name or time range.  

4. **User Story**: As a developer, I want tests covering callback registration and trace retrieval.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - End-to-end test: run a sample workflow, assert trace contains expected entries.

## Sprint 6 (Weeks 11–12): REST API, Dev UI & Deployment

**Epic**: Expose framework functionality via HTTP, build a minimal dashboard, and prepare containerization.

1. **User Story**: As a developer, I want REST endpoints to submit events and retrieve session state.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - POST `/v1/events`, GET `/v1/sessions/{id}`.  
   - OpenAPI spec generated.  

2. **User Story**: As a developer, I want a simple React-based Developer UI to visualize trace logs and session memory.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Dashboard page listing active sessions.  
   - On-click drill-down to trace view and memory snapshots.  

3. **User Story**: As a developer, I want Dockerfiles and Helm charts so the framework can be deployed to Kubernetes.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Multi-stage Docker build with Go binary and static assets.  
   - Helm chart values for customizable replicas, resource limits.  

4. **User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want a GitHub Actions pipeline that lints code, runs tests, builds Docker image, and publishes to registry.  
   **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Workflow triggers on push to `main`.  
   - Artifacts include test coverage report and Docker image tag.
