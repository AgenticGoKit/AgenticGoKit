# Advanced Patterns and Best Practices in AgenticGoKit

## Overview

This section covers advanced patterns and best practices for building robust, production-ready multi-agent systems with AgenticGoKit. You'll learn about fault tolerance, error handling strategies, performance optimization, and testing approaches that ensure your agents work reliably at scale.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Circuit Breaker Patterns](circuit-breaker-patterns.md)**: Implementing fault tolerance with circuit breakers
- **[Retry Policies and Error Handling](retry-policies.md)**: Advanced error handling and recovery strategies
- **[Load Balancing and Scaling](load-balancing-scaling.md)**: Horizontal scaling patterns and load distribution
- **[Testing Multi-Agent Systems](testing-strategies.md)**: Comprehensive testing strategies for complex agent interactions

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced patterns, you should be familiar with:

- [Agent Lifecycle](../core-concepts/agent-lifecycle.md)
- [Orchestration Patterns](../orchestration/orchestration-patterns.md)
- [Debugging and Monitoring](../debugging/README.md)
- [State Management](../core-concepts/state-management.md)

## Why Advanced Patterns Matter

Production multi-agent systems face unique challenges:

### 1. Fault Tolerance
- External services may fail or become unavailable
- Network issues can cause intermittent failures
- Agents need to gracefully handle partial system failures

### 2. Performance at Scale
- Systems must handle increasing load without degradation
- Resource usage needs to be optimized and monitored
- Bottlenecks must be identified and resolved

### 3. Reliability
- Systems must recover from failures automatically
- Error propagation needs to be controlled
- Data consistency must be maintained across agents

### 4. Maintainability
- Code must be testable and debuggable
- System behavior must be predictable
- Changes should be deployable with confidence

## Core Principles

### 1. Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully
- Detect failures quickly to minimize impact
- Implement automatic recovery mechanisms
- Provide clear error messages and context

### 2. Design for Observability
- Include comprehensive logging and metrics
- Make system state visible and debuggable
- Enable real-time monitoring and alerting

### 3. Build Resilient Systems
- Assume external dependencies will fail
- Implement timeouts and circuit breakers
- Use retry policies with exponential backoff

### 4. Optimize for Performance
- Monitor resource usage and bottlenecks
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use load balancing for horizontal scaling

## Getting Started

Start with [Circuit Breaker Patterns](circuit-breaker-patterns.md) to learn about implementing fault tolerance, then progress through the other guides based on your specific needs.

## Quick Reference

### Configuration Examples

```toml
# agentflow.toml - Advanced patterns configuration

[error_routing]
enabled = true
max_retries = 3
retry_delay_ms = 1000
enable_circuit_breaker = true

[error_routing.circuit_breaker]
failure_threshold = 5
success_threshold = 3
timeout_ms = 30000
max_concurrent_calls = 2

[error_routing.retry]
max_retries = 3
base_delay_ms = 1000
max_delay_ms = 30000
backoff_factor = 2.0
enable_jitter = true

[mcp.production]
enabled = true
load_balancing = "round_robin"
circuit_breaker_enabled = true
metrics_enabled = true
```

### Key Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Use Case | Benefits | Trade-offs |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| Circuit Breaker | External service failures | Prevents cascade failures | Adds complexity |
| Retry with Backoff | Transient failures | Improves reliability | Increases latency |
| Load Balancing | High availability | Distributes load | Requires coordination |
| Bulkhead | Resource isolation | Limits failure impact | Resource overhead |

## Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Fault Tolerance
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- [ ] Use retry policies with exponential backoff and jitter
- [ ] Set appropriate timeouts for all operations
- [ ] Handle partial failures gracefully

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Monitor key metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- [ ] Implement caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Use connection pooling for external services
- [ ] Profile and optimize hot paths

### ✅ Reliability
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all scenarios
- [ ] Implement health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Plan for disaster recovery

### ✅ Security
- [ ] Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- [ ] Use secure communication channels
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Audit and log security-relevant events

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Cascading Failures
- **Problem**: One failing service brings down the entire system
- **Solution**: Use circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns

### 2. Retry Storms
- **Problem**: Multiple clients retrying simultaneously overwhelm services
- **Solution**: Use exponential backoff with jitter

### 3. Resource Leaks
- **Problem**: Connections, goroutines, or memory not properly cleaned up
- **Solution**: Use defer statements and proper resource management

### 4. Silent Failures
- **Problem**: Errors are swallowed without proper handling
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 1. Measure First
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks
- Use benchmarks to validate optimizations
- Monitor production metrics continuously

### 2. Optimize Strategically
- Focus on the most impactful improvements
- Consider trade-offs between performance and complexity
- Test optimizations thoroughly

### 3. Scale Appropriately
- Start with vertical scaling for simplicity
- Move to horizontal scaling when needed
- Use load balancing to distribute work

## Conclusion

Advanced patterns and best practices are essential for building production-ready multi-agent systems. By implementing proper fault tolerance, error handling, and performance optimization, you can create systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
