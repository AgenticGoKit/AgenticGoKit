# Tool Integration

Your agents now have memory and can work together effectively. Let's take them to the next level by integrating external tools and services. This will transform your agents from conversational assistants into powerful systems that can take real actions in the world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its benefits
- Configure and integrate various MCP tools and servers
- Create agents that can perform web searches, file operations, and API calls
- Build custom tools for specific use cases
- Troubleshoot tool integration issues
- Design secure and efficient tool-enabled workflows

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you've completed:
- âœ… [Adding Memory](./adding-memory.md) - Understanding of memory-enabled agents

## What Are Tools and Why Do Agents Need Them?

Without tools, agents can only generate text responses. With tools, agents can:

- **Search the web** for current information
- **Read and write files** on the local system
- **Make API calls** to external services
- **Perform calculations** and data processing
- **Interact with databases** and other systems
- **Send emails** and notifications
- **Control external devices** and services

Tools transform agents from conversational interfaces into capable digital assistants that can actually accomplish tasks.

## Introduction to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is a standardized protocol that allows AI agents to securely access external tools and data sources. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets your agents connect to almost any service or tool.

### Benefits of MCP

- **Standardized Interface**: One protocol for all tools
- **Security**: Built-in permission and sandboxing systems
- **Discoverability**: Tools can describe their capabilities automatically
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and services
- **Community**: Growing ecosystem of available tools

### How MCP Works

    Agent[AI Agent] --> MCP[MCP Client]
    MCP --> Server1[Web Search Server]
    MCP --> Server2[File System Server]
    MCP --> Server3[API Server]
    MCP --> Server4[Custom Tool Server]
```

1. **MCP Servers** provide tools and capabilities
2. **MCP Client** (built into AgenticGoKit) manages connections
3. **Agents** request tool usage through natural language
4. **Tools** perform actions and return results

## Available MCP Tools

AgenticGoKit supports a wide range of MCP tools:

### Web and Search Tools
- **Web Search**: Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- **Web Scraping**: Extract content from web pages
- **RSS Feeds**: Monitor and read RSS/Atom feeds
- **Social Media**: Interact with Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

### File and System Tools
- **File Operations**: Read, write, create, delete files
- **Directory Management**: Navigate and manage directories
- **System Information**: Get system stats and information
- **Process Management**: Monitor and control processes

### Data and Database Tools
- **SQL Databases**: Query PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **NoSQL Databases**: Work with MongoDB, Redis
- **Spreadsheets**: Read and write Excel, CSV files
- **Data Processing**: Transform and analyze data

### Communication Tools
- **Email**: Send and receive emails
- **Slack**: Post messages and interact with Slack
- **Discord**: Bot functionality for Discord servers
- **SMS**: Send text messages

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Repository management and operations
- **Docker**: Container management
- **Kubernetes**: Cluster operations
- **CI/CD**: Integration with build systems

## Setting Up Tool Integration

Let's create an agent system with web search and file operation capabilities.

### Step 1: Create a Tool-Enabled Project

```bash
agentcli create research-assistant --template tools-enabled
cd research-assistant
```

### Step 2: Configure MCP Tools

Edit `agentflow.toml` to add tool capabilities:

```toml
[agent_flow]
name = "research-assistant"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "A research assistant with web search and file capabilities"

[llm]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 2000

# MCP Configuration
[mcp]

```

### Step 3: Install MCP Dependencies

MCP tools use `uvx` (part of the `uv` Python package manager):

**Install uv:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or using pip
pip install uv
```

### Step 4: Test Tool Integration

```bash
# Test web search capability
go run . -m "Search for the latest developments in renewable energy technology and save the findings to a file"

# Test file operations
go run . -m "Read the research file you just created and provide a summary"

# Test combined capabilities
go run . -m "Research the top 5 programming languages in 2024, analyze the trends, and create a comprehensive report"
```

## Advanced Tool Configuration

### Custom Tool Permissions

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name = "filesystem"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-filesystem"]
env = { 
    "ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES" = "./workspace,./reports,./data",
    "READONLY_DIRECTORIES" = "./config",
    "MAX_FILE_SIZE" = "10MB"
}
```

### Tool-Specific Agent Configuration

```toml
[agents.web_specialist]
role = "web_specialist"
tools_enabled = true
allowed_tools = ["web-search", "http-client"]  # Restrict to specific tools
tool_timeout = 60                              # Tool-specific timeout
system_prompt = """

## Creating Custom Tools

Sometimes you need tools that don't exist in the MCP ecosystem. Here's how to create custom tools:

### Simple Custom Tool Server

Create a custom MCP server for specific business logic:

**`custom-tool-server.py`:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
import json
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent

app = Server("custom-business-tools")

@app.list_tools()
async def list_tools():
    return [
        Tool(
            name="calculate_roi",
            description="Calculate return on investment",
            inputSchema={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "initial_investment": {"type": "number"},
                    "final_value": {"type": "number"},
                    "time_period": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["initial_investment", "final_value", "time_period"]
            }
        ),
        Tool(
            name="format_currency",
            description="Format numbers as currency",
            inputSchema={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "amount": {"type": "number"},
                    "currency": {"type": "string", "default": "USD"}
                },
                "required": ["amount"]
            }
        )
    ]

@app.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict):
    if name == "calculate_roi":
        initial = arguments["initial_investment"]
        final = arguments["final_value"]
        time = arguments["time_period"]
        roi = ((final - initial) / initial) * 100
        return [TextContent(
            type="text",
            text=f"ROI: {roi:.2f}% over {time} years"
        )]
    
    elif name == "format_currency":
        amount = arguments["amount"]
        currency = arguments.get("currency", "USD")
        formatted = f"${amount:,.2f} {currency}"
        return [TextContent(
            type="text",
            text=formatted
        )]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(app.run())
```

### Configure Custom Tool in AgenticGoKit

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name = "business-tools"
command = "python3"
args = ["./custom-tool-server.py"]
env = { "PYTHONPATH" = "." }
```

### Test Custom Tool

```bash
go run . -m "Calculate the ROI for an investment of $10,000 that became $15,000 over 3 years, and format the result as currency"
```

## Tool Security and Best Practices

### Security Considerations

**File System Access:**
```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name = "secure-filesystem"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-filesystem"]
env = { 
    "ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES" = "./safe-workspace",
    "DENIED_EXTENSIONS" = ".exe,.bat,.sh",
    "MAX_FILE_SIZE" = "1MB",
    "READONLY_MODE" = "false"
}
```

**Network Access:**
```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name = "secure-http"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-fetch"]
env = { 
    "ALLOWED_DOMAINS" = "api.example.com,docs.example.com",
    "TIMEOUT_SECONDS" = "30",
    "MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE" = "1MB"
}
```

### Best Practices

**1. Principle of Least Privilege**
Only give agents access to tools they actually need:

```toml
[agents.web_researcher]
tools_enabled = true
allowed_tools = ["web-search"]  # Only web search, no file access

[agents.file_manager]
tools_enabled = true
allowed_tools = ["filesystem"]  # Only file operations, no web access
```

**2. Validate Tool Outputs**
```toml
[agents.cautious_agent]
system_prompt = """
When using tools:
1. Validate tool outputs before using them
2. Handle tool errors gracefully
3. Never execute dangerous operations without confirmation
4. Log all tool usage for audit purposes
"""
```

**3. Monitor Tool Usage**
```bash
# Enable tool usage logging
export AGENTICGOKIT_TOOL_LOGGING=true
go run . -m "Your message"

# Review tool usage logs
agentcli tools usage --last 24h
```

## Troubleshooting Tool Integration

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Tools Not Available:**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
agentcli mcp health

# List available tools
agentcli mcp tools

# Test specific server
agentcli mcp test web-search
```

**Permission Errors:**
- Check file/directory permissions
- Verify environment variables
- Review security restrictions

**Tool Timeouts:**
- Increase timeout settings
- Check network connectivity
- Optimize tool operations

**Performance Issues:**
- Limit concurrent tool usage
- Cache tool results when appropriate
- Use appropriate tool timeouts

### Debugging Tool Operations

```bash
# Enable detailed tool debugging
export AGENTICGOKIT_MCP_DEBUG=true
export AGENTICGOKIT_TOOL_DEBUG=true
go run . -m "Test message with tools"

# Check tool server logs
agentcli mcp logs web-search

# Validate tool configurations
agentcli mcp validate
```
