# Building Workflows

You've mastered individual AgenticGoKit capabilities: agent configuration, multi-agent orchestration, memory systems, and tool integration. Now let's bring everything together to build sophisticated, real-world workflows that solve complex problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Design comprehensive workflows combining multiple AgenticGoKit capabilities
- Build production-ready systems with error handling and resilience
- Create workflows for common business scenarios (research, content creation, data processing)
- Implement monitoring, logging, and performance optimization
- Apply best practices for scalable, maintainable agent systems
- Troubleshoot and debug complex multi-component workflows

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you've completed:
- âœ… [Tool Integration](./tool-integration.md) - Understanding of MCP tools and external integrations

## What Makes a Great Workflow?

A well-designed agent workflow should be:

- **Purpose-Driven**: Solves a specific, well-defined problem
- **Resilient**: Handles errors gracefully and recovers from failures
- **Efficient**: Uses resources optimally and completes tasks in reasonable time
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Observable**: Provides visibility into operations and performance
- **Scalable**: Can handle increased load and complexity

## Workflow Design Patterns

::: info Pattern Selection Guide
Choose the right pattern based on your use case:
- **Research Pipeline**: Information gathering and analysis
- **Content Creation**: Multi-stage content development
- **Data Processing**: Sequential data transformation
:::

### Research and Analysis Pipeline

Perfect for gathering information, analyzing it, and producing insights:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Research Request] --> Planner[Planning Agent]
    Planner --> Researcher[Research Agent]
    Planner --> Validator[Validation Agent]
    Researcher --> |Web Search| WebTools[Web Tools]
    Researcher --> |Save Data| FileTools[File Tools]
    Researcher --> Analyzer[Analysis Agent]
    Validator --> |Check Sources| WebTools
    Analyzer --> |Read Data| FileTools
    Analyzer --> Writer[Report Writer]
    Writer --> |Save Report| FileTools
    Writer --> Output[Final Report]
```

### Content Creation Workflow

Ideal for creating high-quality content with multiple review stages:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Brief[Content Brief] --> Researcher[Research Agent]
    Researcher --> |Gather Info| Tools[Web/File Tools]
    Researcher --> Outliner[Outline Agent]
    Outliner --> Writer[Content Writer]
    Writer --> Editor[Editor Agent]
    Editor --> Reviewer[Quality Reviewer]
    Reviewer --> |Approved| Final[Final Content]
    Reviewer --> |Needs Work| Writer
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

Great for handling data transformation and analysis tasks:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Data[Raw Data] --> Validator[Data Validator]
    Validator --> Cleaner[Data Cleaner]
    Cleaner --> Processor[Data Processor]
    Processor --> Analyzer[Data Analyzer]
    Analyzer --> Visualizer[Report Generator]
    Visualizer --> Output[Final Reports]
```
