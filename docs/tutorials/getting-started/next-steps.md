Title: Memory not persisting between agent runs

I'm trying to set up persistent memory with PostgreSQL, but my agents 
don't remember previous conversations.

Configuration:
[agent_memory]
provider = "pgvector"
connection_string = "postgresql://agent:pass@localhost:5432/agentdb"

Error message:
Error: failed to connect to database: connection refused

What I've tried:
- Verified PostgreSQL is running
- Checked connection string format
- Tested connection with psql

Environment:
- AgenticGoKit v0.3.0
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector
- macOS 14.0
```
