# Multi-Agent Basics

Now that you've mastered single agent configuration, let's explore one of AgenticGoKit's most powerful features: multi-agent orchestration. You'll learn how to create teams of specialized agents that work together to solve complex problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Understand when and why to use multiple agents
- Configure different orchestration patterns (collaborative, sequential, route)
- Create specialized agents that work together effectively
- Choose the right orchestration pattern for different scenarios
- Build and test multi-agent workflows
- Troubleshoot multi-agent system issues

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you've completed:
- âœ… [Agent Configuration](./agent-configuration.md) - Understanding of agent configuration and customization

## Why Use Multiple Agents?

Single agents are powerful, but multiple agents working together can accomplish much more sophisticated tasks. Here's why:

### Division of Labor
Instead of one agent trying to do everything, specialized agents excel at specific tasks:

- **Research Agent**: Excellent at finding and gathering information
- **Analysis Agent**: Specializes in processing and interpreting data
- **Writing Agent**: Focuses on creating clear, engaging content
- **Validation Agent**: Ensures accuracy and quality

### Parallel Processing
Multiple agents can work simultaneously, dramatically reducing processing time for complex tasks.

### Better Quality
Specialized agents often produce higher quality results in their domain than generalist agents.

### Resilience
If one agent encounters issues, others can continue working or compensate.

## Orchestration Patterns

AgenticGoKit supports several orchestration patterns, each suited for different scenarios:

### Collaborative Orchestration
Agents work in parallel, and their results are combined.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[User Input] --> Coordinator[Coordinator]
    Coordinator --> Agent1[Research Agent]
    Coordinator --> Agent2[Analysis Agent]
    Coordinator --> Agent3[Writing Agent]
    Agent1 --> Combiner[Result Combiner]
    Agent2 --> Combiner
    Agent3 --> Combiner
    Combiner --> Output[Final Output]
```

**Best for**: Research tasks, content creation, analysis requiring multiple perspectives

### Sequential Orchestration
Agents work one after another, each building on the previous agent's work.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Input[User Input] --> Agent1[Data Processor]
    Agent1 --> Agent2[Analyzer]
    Agent2 --> Agent3[Report Generator]
    Agent3 --> Output[Final Output]
```

**Best for**: Data processing pipelines, step-by-step workflows, quality assurance processes

### Route Orchestration
Requests are routed to the most appropriate agent based on content or rules.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[User Input] --> Router[Router]
    Router --> Agent1[Technical Support]
    Router --> Agent2[Billing Support]
    Router --> Agent3[General Support]
    Agent1 --> Output[Response]
    Agent2 --> Output
    Agent3 --> Output
```

**Best for**: Customer service, content categorization, specialized help systems

## Building Your First Multi-Agent System

Let's create a research team that can gather information, analyze it, and create a comprehensive report.

### Step 1: Create the Project

```bash
agentcli create research-team --template basic
cd research-team
```

### Step 2: Configure the Multi-Agent System

Edit `agentflow.toml` to create a collaborative research team:

```toml
[agent_flow]
name = "research-team"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "A collaborative team of research specialists"

[llm]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4"

1. All three agents receive the request simultaneously
2. The **researcher** gathers information about renewable energy
3. The **analyzer** identifies trends and patterns
4. The **writer** creates a comprehensive report
5. Results are combined into a final response

## Sequential Orchestration Example

Let's create a data processing pipeline that handles information step-by-step:

```toml
[orchestration]
mode = "sequential"
sequential_agents = ["validator", "processor", "formatter"]

[agents.validator]
role = "data_validator"

"""
enabled = true
```

## Route Orchestration Example

Create a customer service system that routes requests to appropriate specialists:

```toml
[orchestration]
mode = "route"
routing_rules = [
    { pattern = "technical|bug|error|code", agent = "technical_support" },
    { pattern = "billing|payment|invoice|charge", agent = "billing_support" },
    { pattern = "account|login|password|access", agent = "account_support" }
]
default_agent = "general_support"

[agents.technical_support]

```

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build a Content Creation Team

Create a collaborative team for content creation:

1. **Research Agent**: Gathers information on the topic
2. **Outline Agent**: Creates a structured outline
3. **Writing Agent**: Writes the content
4. **Editor Agent**: Reviews and refines the content

Test with: "Create a comprehensive guide about getting started with Go programming"

### Exercise 2: Create a Data Analysis Pipeline

Build a sequential system for data analysis:

1. **Data Collector**: Gathers relevant data
2. **Data Cleaner**: Validates and cleans the data
3. **Analyzer**: Performs statistical analysis
4. **Report Generator**: Creates final reports

Test with: "Analyze the trends in remote work adoption over the past 5 years"

### Exercise 3: Build a Help Desk System

Create a routing system for different types of support requests:

1. **Technical Support**: Handles technical issues
2. **Account Support**: Manages account problems
3. **General Support**: Handles other inquiries

Test with various request types to see routing in action.

## Monitoring Multi-Agent Systems

### Understanding Agent Interactions

AgenticGoKit provides logging to help you understand how agents work together:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export AGENTICGOKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
go run . -m "Your test message"
```

Look for log entries showing:
- Agent initialization
- Task distribution
- Agent processing times
- Result combination

### Performance Considerations

**Collaborative Systems:**
- Agents work in parallel (more efficient overall)
- Resource usage is higher (multiple agents active)
- Good for tasks requiring diverse expertise

**Sequential Systems:**
- Agents work one at a time (lower resource usage)
- Total time is sum of all agent times
- Good for step-by-step processes

**Route Systems:**
- Only one agent active per request (most efficient)
- Routing logic adds small overhead
- Good for specialized, focused tasks

## Troubleshooting Multi-Agent Systems

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Agents Not Collaborating Effectively:**
- Review system prompts for clarity
- Ensure agents have complementary roles
- Check that collaborative_agents list is correct

**Sequential Pipeline Breaks:**
- Verify each agent can handle the previous agent's output
- Check that sequential_agents order is logical
- Ensure proper error handling between stages

**Routing Not Working:**
- Review routing patterns and rules
- Test with clear, unambiguous requests
- Check default_agent configuration

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor resource usage with multiple agents
- Consider timeout settings
- Optimize agent system prompts for efficiency

### Debugging Techniques

```bash
# Test individual agents
agentcli test-agent researcher "Find information about renewable energy"

# Validate configuration
agentcli validate

# Check agent connectivity
agentcli health-check
```

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Systems

### 1. Design Clear Agent Roles

Each agent should have a distinct, well-defined purpose:

```toml
# Good: Clear, specific roles
[agents.fact_checker]
role = "fact_verification"
description = "Verifies accuracy of claims and statements"

[agents.source_finder]
role = "source_identification"
description = "Finds and evaluates source credibility"

# Avoid: Overlapping or vague roles
[agents.helper1]
role = "general_helper"
description = "Helps with various tasks"
```

### 2. Optimize Agent Communication

Design agents to work well together:

```toml
[agents.researcher]
system_prompt = """
You gather information and always structure your findings as:
1. Key Facts: [bullet points]
2. Sources: [when available]
3. Confidence Level: [high/medium/low]
4. Gaps: [what information is missing]

This format helps other agents process your findings effectively.
"""
```

### 3. Handle Edge Cases

Plan for scenarios where agents might fail or produce unexpected results:

```toml
[orchestration]
mode = "collaborative"
timeout_seconds = 120  # Prevent hanging
retry_attempts = 2     # Retry failed agents
fallback_agent = "general_assistant"  # Backup option
```

### 4. Test Thoroughly

Test your multi-agent system with various scenarios:

- Simple requests each agent can handle
- Complex requests requiring all agents
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance under load
