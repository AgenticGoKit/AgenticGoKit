# Getting Started with AgenticGoKit

Welcome to AgenticGoKit! You're about to discover how to build sophisticated AI agent systems using the performance and reliability of Go. Whether you're new to AI agents or experienced with other frameworks, this tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- **Build intelligent agents** that can reason, remember, and take actions
- **Orchestrate multiple agents** to work together on complex tasks
- **Add memory and knowledge** to make your agents smarter over time
- **Integrate external tools** to extend your agents' capabilities
- **Create production-ready workflows** that handle real-world scenarios

## Why AgenticGoKit?

AgenticGoKit brings the power of AI agents to Go developers with:

- **Native Go Performance**: Compiled binaries with efficient memory usage
- **Configuration-First Approach**: Define your agents and workflows in simple TOML files
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built specifically for agent collaboration patterns
- **Production Ready**: Error handling, monitoring, and scaling built-in
- **Tool Integration**: MCP protocol support for dynamic tool discovery
