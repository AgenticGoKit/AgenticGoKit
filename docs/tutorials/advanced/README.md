# Advanced Tutorials

**Production patterns and optimization techniques**

This section covers advanced topics for building production-ready agent systems with AgenticGoKit. These tutorials assume familiarity with basic AgenticGoKit concepts.

## Advanced Topics

- **[Circuit Breaker Patterns](circuit-breaker-patterns.md)** - Implement resilient agent systems
- **[Retry Policies](retry-policies.md)** - Handle failures gracefully
- **[Testing Strategies](testing-strategies.md)** - Test multi-agent systems effectively
- **[Load Balancing and Scaling](load-balancing-scaling.md)** - Scale agents horizontally

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should:

- Complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) tutorials
- Understand [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/)
- Have experience with Go testing and production deployment

## Production Focus

These tutorials emphasize:

- **Reliability**: Building fault-tolerant systems
- **Performance**: Optimizing for speed and efficiency
- **Scalability**: Handling increased load
- **Maintainability**: Testing and monitoring strategies

## Next Steps

After mastering these advanced concepts:

- Explore [How-To Guides](../../guides/) for specific implementation tasks
- Check [API Reference](../../reference/) for detailed interface documentation
- Consider [Contributing](../../contributors/) to the AgenticGoKit project
